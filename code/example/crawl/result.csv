0,6/10,Under the Sun of Satan (Sous le soleil de Satan) (Under Satan's Sun),"""A drama that addresses interesting concepts about asceticism, theology and the moral decline of the faith, but somehow its narrative lacks emotional strength with the journey of the tormented priest. [Full review in Spanish]""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 8:16 PM UTC",Yasser Medina  Cinemaficionados
1,3/4,Coup 53,"""Amirani's filmmaking process is akin to watching a detective at work.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 8:02 PM UTC",Mark Dujsik  Mark Reviews Movies
2,,The One and Only Ivan,"""'The One And Only Ivan' hearkens back to the Disney Classics of yore. Diane Warren's breathtaking song 'Free' is destined to become a classic. Clever and poignant, 'Ivan' is a winning tale of the preciousness and sanctity of animals. ""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 7:02 PM UTC",Leah Sydney  Showbiz 411
3,8/10,Feels Good Man,"""A cautionary tale about how the most innocent creation can become twisted into something else entirely. And when that happens can it be saved?""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 6:44 PM UTC",Nathaniel Muir  AIPT
4,4.5/5,The One and Only Ivan,"""A talking animal Disney film that scores a bullseye and hits the heart in ways that transcend its genre much like ""Babe"" did a quarter of a century ago. ""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 6:29 PM UTC",Pete Hammond  Deadline Hollywood Daily
5,,The Last Movie Star,"""The Last Movie Star aka Dog Years, directed by director Adam Rifkin, is Burt Reynolds' swan song, and a poignant and entertaining treasure. ""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 6:28 PM UTC",Lisa Johnson Mandell  AtHomeInHollywood.com
6,C-,Unhinged,"""The movie's biggest injustice... besides its hammy missteps into social commentary, may be what it does to Crowe.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:50 PM UTC",Leah Greenblatt  Entertainment Weekly
7,,The Cuban,"""The Cuban lifts the spirit and fills the heart""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:49 PM UTC",Debbie Lynn Elias  Behind The Lens
8,B-,Martin Margiela: In His Own Words,"""While Margiela's visions likely deserve a more radical treatment onscreen, Holzemer's film offers perhaps the most complete insight yet into one of fashion's most elusive geniuses.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:49 PM UTC",Ryan Lattanzio  indieWire
9,,Happily Ever After,"""Humorous but uncompromising""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:31 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa

11,,seaburners,"""Esen's acting is suitably erratic for his character, while Furlan's intensity provides the unusual relationship, and indeed the whole film, with strong emotional tension.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:28 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
12,,Das finstere Tal (The Dark Valley),"""The dark atmosphere is complemented by some fairly effective gory deaths, but the film frequently goes over the top in its seriousness and intensity.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:26 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
13,,The Two Faces of January,"""This Hitchcock-style thriller, set in 1962, feels like it was also made in that decade, and compared to most modern films of the genre, it turns out to be very refreshing.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:24 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
14,,Patardzlebi,"""The ancient Greek tragedy as a form and its emotional impact have not had such an accomplished modern update on film in a long time.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:23 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
15,,La Jungla Interior,"""The director manages to build a considerable tension in the brisk 72 minutes, and the final moments of the film pay off strongly.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:22 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
16,,Losejas,"""A masterfully crafted and gripping drama with more than a dash of thriller.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:20 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
17,,Pine Ridge,"""[Director Anna] Eborn builds a palpable atmosphere... triggering empathy, an emotion much more meaningful and sincere than sympathy that most similarly themed documentaries calculate to achieve.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 5:07 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa

22,,Tanta agua,"""The daughter-father relationship and coming-of-age story is engaging, tender and subtly funny, with extremely sensitive performances from its two leads.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 4:41 PM UTC",Vladan Petkovic  Cineuropa
23,,In the Strange Pursuit of Laura Durand,"""[A] lack of consistency... prevents Laura Durand from really catching fire.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 4:39 PM UTC",Allan Hunter  Screen International
24,,Crazy Samurai Musashi,"""One gets the impression you're not watching a professionally-made samurai movie as much as a YouTube video of an amateur katana enthusiast farting around in the park with his friends.""  Posted Aug 18, 2020 4:39 PM UTC",Clint Worthington  The Spool
